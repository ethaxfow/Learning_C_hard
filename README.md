So far I get stuck in Chapter 1 exercise 13 which is really difficult for me, I want to print both of horizontal and vertical historam in one program.

- **Exercise 1-13** Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is
easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.
